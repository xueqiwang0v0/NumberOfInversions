# NumberOfInversions
This is a python and C++ version of computing number of inversions in a given array.

The 'IntegerArray.txt' file contains all of the 100,000 integers between 1 and 100,000
(inclusive) in some order, with no integer repeated.

Your task is to compute the number of inversions in the file given, where the i^{th}
 row of the file indicates the i^{th} entry of an array.

Because of the large size of this array, you should implement the fast divide-and-conquer
algorithm covered in the video lectures.

The python version can fulfill the assignment. The C++ version can only work when the array
is small.
